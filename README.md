### What I learned

I got good understand of flexbox and how to set the apporpiate `width` property for an image within a container. 

Helped me to learn how to set `@font-face` in CSS for variable fonts.

I also got an understanding on how to use `flexbox`, `flex-direction`, `transitions` and pseudo attribute like `:hover` and `:focus`

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn how build a responsive site by using Mobile-first workflow and flexbox.
